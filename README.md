/* Introduction — Cohort Analysis & Customer Segmentation
Understanding customer behavior over time is essential for improving retention and designing effective growth strategies. 

Cohort analysis helps track groups of customers based on when they first made a purchase and measures how many of them return in later periods. This provides clear insight into retention patterns and the impact of campaigns such as promotions or discount vouchers.

Complementing this, customer segmentation—using techniques like RFM analysis—groups customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value. 

These segments support targeted actions such as personalized recommendations, retention emails, live-chat support, or promotional campaigns designed for high-value or at-risk customers.

In this section, we use SQL to perform both analyses for the Electricity product, helping identify customer lifecycle trends and actionable opportunities to improve overall retention./*
